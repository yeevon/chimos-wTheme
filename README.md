BELOW CAN BE ADDED AT A LATER DATE IF DESIRED,

Section for streaming YouTube videos -

First do you currently have videos that you would like to stream? YES
Easiest way to implement this is to host videos via a site like YouTube and I can display the hosted video in Chimons
When adding new videos do you have someone who can update the code to display the new videos if not would you need another app where it would let you add or change videos (medium size project) NO, we don’t.  We would need the app, but what does it entail?
or do you want Chimons site to go and check latest videos added and display for example latest 3 (Large project) Please explain further.

careers page - do you want to advertise job openings you currently have if you do will you have someone who can update the website or do you need another web app where you can populate job description and it will display on this website (Creating page simple, other app to populate medium size project) We would advertise job openings and would need the web app.


online sales or links - 

Somewhere user can go to purchase your product or does this need to be built in this site in future release (Large Project) Yes, it needs to be built in the site
Another option is to link to third party site (example: amazon or equivalent) that already sells your products (simple to implement as long as it doesn't violate other websites terms most sites will not complain about driving traffic to them but need to contact them to be sure) NO, no third party site.

customer review - do you want to give customers the ability to review your product (small - medium size project) or show feeds for customer review sites where you already being reviewed (implementation will depend on there api usually not to complicated) YES
