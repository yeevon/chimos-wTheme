	section for streamig youtube videos - 
		First do you currently have videos that you would like to stream?
		Easiest way to implement this is to host videos via a site like youtube and I can display the hosted
			vidoe in chimons
		When adding new videos do you have someone who can update the code to display the new vidoes if not
			would you need another app where it would let you add or change videos (medium size project)
			or want chimons site to go and check latest vidoes added and display for example latest 3
			(Large project)

	careers page: do you want to advertise job openings you currently have if you do will you have someone who
		can update the website or do you need another webApp where you can populate job decription and it
		will display on this website (Creating page simple, other app to populate medium size project)

	online sales or links - somewhere user can go to purchase your product or does this need to be built in this
		site in future release (large Project)
		other option is to link to third party site (example: amazon or equivalent) that already sells your
			product (simple to implement as long as it doesn't violate other websites terms most sites
				will not complain about driving traffic to them but need to contact them to be sure)

	customer review - do you want to give customers the ability to review your product (small - medium size project)
		or show feeds for customer review sites where you already being reviewed (implementation will depend
		on there api usually not to complicated)
